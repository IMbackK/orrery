I thank the International Meteor Organization
(http://www.imo.net/imo/intro)
for permission to use their data to produce the meteor shower
related displays.

The planetary positions are produced using the document
titled "Keplerian Elements for Approximate Positions of the
Major Planets" by E.M. Standish (JPL/Caltech) available from
the JPL Solar System Dynamics web site (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/).

Star positions are from the Hipparcos catalog
See http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS

Heiko Stubner provided patches (now folded into the code)
to fix some bugs related to reading ASCII data files.

BIG thanks to Joshua Rosen, who contributed bug fixes
and put together a sane set of autotools files.
