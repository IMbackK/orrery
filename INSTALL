This program is intended to be used on Nokia N900 phones.   If you
just want to run the program, it is much easier to install the
binary files than to compile from sources, because to compile,
you'll need to build an Maemo 5 crossdevelopement environment,
or get gnu software development tools running on your phone.
The binary files can be installed from the Maemo 5 Extras
repository.

The autotools configuration files in this package work properly
in the Maemo 5 scratchbox development environment.   They have not
been tested in any other environment.

If you have any problems with, or comments about the orrery or its
installation, please send a message to orrery.moko@gmail.com.
